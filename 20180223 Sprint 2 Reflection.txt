Sprint review (Nick and Jack):
good:
--got search alg prototype
--front end started
--better idea of project

could be better:
--communication with calvin
--refine search algorithm
--more modular code


Still needs to be done:
--Flask integration
--documentation
--comment code
--add accidentals and octaves to search

What we need to know from community partner meeting:
--Confirm priorities list
--Confirm what he wants the endpoints to be (very start of input, exactly what they get out)
--What exact search would you use this for?
--will the average user be able to create an MEI snippet?
--What information does the user want about the search results?
--do you have that site that displays pdfs of Chopin measures?

Group Retrospective (just nick and jack here):
--better communication than last sprint
--still need a better breakdown of exactly what components we need to add
--need to communicate with calvin more
--confused about where to go, it'd benefit us to lay out a concrete plan
--need to meet more consistently to work
--need to assign specific tasks/modular portions of project to each person so everyone has
  something to contribute and some direction
  --we failed again to concretely decide areas for each person.
