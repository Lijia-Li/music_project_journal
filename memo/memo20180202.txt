Feb 02 - Minutes
Project Name: ReChord
Minutes by: Nick Bethune


Met with Justin to talk about project
-Discussed XPath as a possible method of parsing MEI files
-Decided to implement search before outlining class diagram
 -Reason: Search alg is minimum viable product right now, most important thing to get working
  -Easy to work out classes after we have an understanding of how search works
-Worked on getting everyone up to speed with GitKraken (Thanks Lijia!)
-Discussed possible issue of XPath interaction with Chord Subfolders causing notes to not all have
 the same parent node
 -Nick will look into MEI formatting and possible ways to solve
Moving Forward:
-we'll meet monday morning before class
-Lijia will work on algorithm, Nick/Jack will get fluent with Git
-Everyone should get Python IDEs up and running and then work with XPath and XML docs using Python
-
