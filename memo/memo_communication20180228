Communication Issues Feb 28
Not spending enough time on the project

- Meeting
  - No shows
    - I apologize, my body is not cooperating lately 
  - Hard to find meeting time
    - #resolution: trying to have one coding meeting per week (#todo)
  - Generally inefficient:
    - Not come prepared
    - Do not have a decent agenda: so that everybody is not on the same page of what we are discussing and what can they contribute
    - Agreed things were not substantiated later
    - #resolution: more specific on Trello, 
    - #resolution: meeting agenda on Paper. 
- Tasks Assignment
  - also as a female, although you might disagree, I do feel like 
    - my words are sometime ignored 
      - #resolution: check slack more often
      - #resolution: please reply
      - #resolution: even when talking about the same issue, other group member are more heard than I was
    - I act like a mom figure  *hell no!!!!!!
      - clean code (which I apologize)
      - other errand that people are often forgetting and thus I would ask several time to make sure people are working on it. 
        - e.g. email to Calvin about meeting time/user experience
      - #resolution please be more accountable on the thing that you agreed on; if you can not do it, donâ€™t agree. And constant keep updating with each other.
- Trello: 
  - Generally not organized 
    - partly because we are not on the same page on the project
  - #resolution: Time Estimate & Due Dates & Member Assignment
