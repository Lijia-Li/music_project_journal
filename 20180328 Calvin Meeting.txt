Calvin Meeting Notes 3/28/18

-Demoed front end
-Calvin was confused whether term search required a snippet pasted in other tab
-tempo marking tab:
--radio button next to each type of note (eighth, quarter, eighth with dot, etc) and a box to put in tempo (ex. 72)
--some have metronome marking, others have just a word (ex. allegro)

-interested in the dictionary which includes abbreviations for a word s.t they all get returned if you search even just the abbrev
-we requested MEI file with piano fingerings
-take slur, ornamental, notes, accidental out of text search
-prioritize expressive term, tempo marking, dynamic markings
-need to talk about our database of MEI files and copyright issues
-potentially adding this/giving access to the official MEI initiative
-still hoping to make it possible to link to pdf

by end of semester:
--make sure search box works
--have name of piece in results page
--finish tempo marking section
