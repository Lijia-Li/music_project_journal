Reflection: 3/7/18
How did the user testing/feedback session go? What did you expect to learn? What did you actually learn?
--The session went really well, I definitely got a more concrete idea of the necessary steps to move the project in the correct direction. I expected
  to learn what a typical user wants from our program and what the priorities for development are, which we definitely got, but we also learned more
  about how users want to be able to interact with our UI and what things are important to ensure our backend is utilized by those who will be using it.

What, if anything, have you learned about interacting with real clients on real projects?
--I definitely learned that clients, like all people, have a disconnect between the vision they have for a project and their ability to verbalize what
  they want from it. Our meeting reinforced to me the necessity of an open line of communication and semi-consistent checkins with a client in order
  to ensure that the project is pushed in the right direction.

Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?
--My fears are the same, as we haven't finished integrating our front and back end yet, but with the addition of the fear of finding out that some parts of
  our backend don't work correctly with the flask setup on our frontend. My hopes from last time have been realized, with us getting our
  expressive term search, and my new hopes are to improve on the search algorithm as well as get our GUI at least partially integrated with the expressive
  term and articulation methods so we can begin functional  testing of the project as a whole.
