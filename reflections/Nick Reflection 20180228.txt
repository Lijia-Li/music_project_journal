Nick Bethune--2/28 reflection
Reflect on the agile/scrum process. What are it's started goals? Based on your project so far, is that process achieving those goals for your team? Why/Why not?
--The goals of the agile/scrum process are to create an environment where the team is its own leadership, meaning people hold each other accountable and make sure
  that everyone is achieving their sprint goals. Its other goal is to make the project adaptable to new issues that rise up, and deploying modular code so adjustments
  can be made. I think the process is helping our team, but we need to adhere more strictly to scrum practices so that we have a strong idea of what tasks each of us
  are responsible for. 

Reflect on your communication with your community partner. Do you think you are on the same page? Why/why not?
--I think we had trouble communicating with Calvin but after our meeting yesterday I feel strongly that things are going to improve. I think we are now on the same page
  about what we want the final product to look like and what deliverables to prioritize in the short term. For the future, I think maintaining an open line of communication
  will benefit our team and ensure that we are continuing to move in the right direction.

Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?
--My previous fears regarding communication have gotten a lot better--I feel like our team is more on the same page both with each other and with our community partner. My new
  fears are just making sure our back end and front end work well together as we move forward. My hopes are the same as before, with the addition of getting a finished search
  for expressive terms by the end of this sprint.
