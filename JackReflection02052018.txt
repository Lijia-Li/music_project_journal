Jack Neary Reflection

Our project is to create a search engine that will find matches in music notation between
	MEI files. We will be allowing the end user to be able to pick what sort of criteria
	would like to search by and allow them to find the closest matches to the
	submitted xml file.

I was hoping to get this project and was so excited when I did. The meeting with the 
	community partner really just firmed up the ideas that I had about the project
	and what it would entail. The UI that he was hoping to achieve in the end was
	the only real surprise along with the file type that we would need to use (MEI
	instead of just regular XML)

I am excited to get going on the project! I am hoping to get a comprehensive understanding
	of what our program will look like and learn Python along the way! This will be 
	a very fun project. I am hoping to get in on the coding soon, but we are currently
	limiting it to a 2-person job.
